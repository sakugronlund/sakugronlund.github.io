<div class="col-sm-8">Sometime during 2019 I decided to up my cooking game, seriously. So seriously in fact, that I didn't like eating at restaurants anymore. Every dish seemed to be compromised with excessive prep, meats were par-boiled for faster serving, vegetables were barely browned and the wine lists were cheap garbage being sold at a huge markup. So I decided to try my hand at the restaurant business and serve the kind of food I want to eat, the kind of food that actually is worth the customer's time and money; we only serve properly brined meats, vegetables that are actually fried, wines worth telling a friend about. Restaurants used to be the benchmark for cooking skill and quality in food. We aim to make that a reality again. Less branding. Less excess. Dining at a restaurant doesn't need to be an "experience" if the food speaks for itself. And if the food isn't great, then what's the point? <br><br><b>Come, and enjoy something better.</b>
